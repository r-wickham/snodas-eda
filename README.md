# To Do
 - [ ] Better logic for getting SNODAS: first check if available data is
         already downloaded to snodas dl dir, dl if needed, then add
         better logic to load fn so that it can interpret the 
         correct parameter type given the file name
 - [ ] Add date as column to data.frame
 - [ ] Check if can load from raster file prior to download
 - [ ] Extract available SNOTEL data and add to data.frames
